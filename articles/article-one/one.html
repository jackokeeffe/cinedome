        <p>The most relatable films convey primal
            themes that explore human impulses.
            These are films about friendship, love,
            betrayal, death, loss, and revenge, but
            sadly one very important primal theme
            is often glanced over: food.</p>
        <p>Food might be the key point to survival,
            nonetheless, it’s often absent in the vast sea
            of films that focus on a protagonist trying to
            survive. Luckily some movies focus purely
            on the art of preparing and consuming food.
            Think of films like Delicatessen (1991), Festen (1998), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), La Grande Bouffe (1973),
            Spirited Away (2001), and Babette’s Feast
            (1987). Of course, one film tops them all. A
            film that’s not just about consuming or preparing food, but about the reverence of food
            as a lifestyle. That film is director Juzo Itami’s
            noodle Western ‘Tampopo.’</p>
            <p>The film follows two cowboy-like truckers,
            Gorō (Tsutomu Yamazaki) and Gun (Ken
            Watanabe), who stop at a noodle shop to feed
            up before continuing with work. The shop
            is owned by the friendly Tampopo (Nobuko
            Miyamoto), a female chef insecure about her
            noodle-preparing skills. When Tampopo asks
            the truckers for an honest opinion on her
            trade, Gorō gives her a brutally honest answer
            and advice on how to improve. Tampopo can
            very much appreciate this honesty and begs
            him to be her teacher and help her shop flourish.</p>

            <p>The main plot quirkily follows Tampopo as
            she gradually improves thanks to the lessons
            of various noodle masters spliced between
            Rocky-like training montages. However,
            what’s more interesting than this main plot
            are the short vignettes that explore the different sides of love intertwined throughout,
            sometimes quite literally. The short stories include an etiquette class on how to properly eat
            spaghetti, an old lady obsessed with squeezing the food in the supermarket, a housewife
            rising from her deathbed to cook one last
            meal, and many more hilariously beautiful
            moments. Even though a great portion of the
            film is catered towards Japanese culture, it’s a
            very universal film.</p>
            <p>Itami’s Hollywood and Western genre tropes
            make for an accessible style, but most of this
            universality comes from the primal depiction
            of the themes. Itami plays with this quite brilliantly in the film’s introduction. The fourth
            wall is broken as a well-dressed man speaks
            to us, the audience, and asks about our favorite movie snack while he shows his own.
            Throughout the film we’re constantly tantalized by delicious dishes which we can almost
            smell and taste. This interaction keeps us
            glued to the screen and longing for a bowl of
            ramen noodles weeks after the film has ended. I wonder why this primal theme, food, is
            not explored as often as, say, love and death?
            Why aren’t there more films like Ratatouille
            (2007), My Dinner with André (1981), Jídlo
            (1992), Chef (2014), and of course Tampopo?
            Yes, it’s true many films have amazing food
            scenes. Hopefully in the future we’ll see more
            films that elevate food beyond portrayal and
            treat food as a lifestyle; breathe food, just like
            Tampopo.</p>
