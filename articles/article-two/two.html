    <div id="text">
        <p>In the 1990s ‘irony’ was both expanded and
            degraded through a steamrolling expansion of the
            word’s meaning. Alanis Morissette is the obvious
            example; as we all know that “rain on your wedding
            day” and the like isn’t ‘ironic’, but perhaps that fact
            itself is the irony. Are you being sarcastic dude? I
            don’t even know anymore.</p>
        <p>Aided by, and in turn of aid, the rise of irony was a
            concurrent rise of American indie cinema. After a
            flush of underground hit films (Reservoir Dogs; sex,
            lies and videotape) it became in vogue for American
            studios to fund, through subsidy companies, the
            work of a new generation of auteurs. Whilst the
            filmmakers of the 1960s and ‘70s were the first to
            be educated by older cinema, the writer-directors
            of the ‘90s were educated by their forefathers’
            educations, resulting in something of a postmodern
            approach. Pulp Fiction, the defining movie of the
            era, is renowned as a bastion of cool, but even in
            the movie’s most famous dance scene there is a
            distinct veneer of irony—nobody is supposed to
            take the lame kitschy nostalgia of Jack Rabbit Slim’s
            seriously. The postmodernists are attracted to irony
            due to its mild subversion, its ability to “hollow out
            a character or idea” through negation.</p>
            <p>Whit Stillman, a preppy East Coast liberal, and
                master of the modern comedy of manners, occupies
                a unique place within this generation. He would
                probably feel uncomfortable being shoehorned into
                that group, or any. (In interviews he has sung the
                praises of Mumblecore, though admits he has never
                actually seen any such films, a move not entirely
                unfamiliar to fans of his debut film Metropolitan.
                3) His artistic lineage stems more from Jane Austen, whom he adapted in both literary and cinematic
                form in 2016 after years of flirtation and reference.
                He has confessed (to the Jane Austen Society of
                North America no less) that he would take frequent
                breaks from writing early in his career, “cleans[ing]
                the palate” with a few pages of Pride and Prejudice.
                4) Another source of common comparison is Woody
                Allen, a more frequent chronicler of wealthy New
                York wit, however whilst Allen’s films centre on
                a financially self-sufficient, often Jewish, middle
                class, Stillman isn’t afraid to directly address the
                upper class—a class most Americans didn’t believe
                existed.</p>


                <p>Stillman was, and remains, politically, ideologically,
                    visually, and sartorially at odds with his
                    contemporaries. His films are, as described by Peter
                    Augustine Lawler, “Socratic, Christian, and at least
                    ambiguously conservative”.6 Small ‘c’ conservative
                    that is, his father was an advisor to Kennedy
                    after all, conservative as he seeks to ‘conserve’ the
                    seemingly archaic values and behaviours of ‘old
                    money’. There seems to be an impression amongst
                    some audiences and critics that Stillman embodies
                    typical ‘90s irony, but rather than indulging in
                    sardonic pastiche Stillman wears his irony lightly,
                    like his literary forebears. This may stem from a
                    reluctance among a typically left-leaning ‘indie’
                    audience to acknowledge that the films they cackle
                    at may, in fact, be celebrating the charms of the
                    upper class, or condemning anti-NATO sentiment.
                    In Metropolitan, the viewer scoffs at Charlie’s
                    lament over the misleading title of Buñuel’s The
                    Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, but by the
                    film’s climax we are morally united behind the
                    conservative members of the Sally Fowler Rat Pack as they pick on Rick von Slonicker, the preening
                    European breaking up their group. Perhaps there is
                    something of a discreet charm.</p>

                    <img src="images/discreet-3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p id="subtitle">Image from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)</p>
                    
                <p>The irony of Metropolitan is immediately apparent
                    to most viewers: a movie about super wealthy
                    people made for almost no money at all. I am not
                    the first critic to note that there’s something of an
                    early Éric Rohmer to the short shot composition
                    and general visual aesthetic of the film, but these
                    are not spunky young Parisians. To the Rat Pack
                    (or ‘Urban-Haute Bourgeoisie’/‘UHB’, another,
                    frankly ridiculous, name they are given,) “orgy
                    week” is played out in a slightly stale game of
                    strip poker, and drug taking is done quietly in the
                    corner. Nick Smith (Chris Eigeman), the group’s
                    de facto leader and pompous wit-in-chief has a
                    self-deprecating streak that may distract from the
                    sincere enjoyment he takes in playing bridge and
                    finding suitable bachelors for the young women
                    of the Pack. Eigeman, whose performances are
                    one of the linking characteristics of the ‘doomed-
                    bourgeois-in-love’ trilogy which kickstarted
                    Stillman’s career, is pivotal to the charm of these
                    films, perfectly translating the ‘loveable dick’
                    persona of Bill Murray and his ilk over to a more
                    ostensibly highbrow environment. Whether he’s
                    the charismatic spokesperson of Metropolitan, the
                    earnest patriot of Barcelona or the drugged-up
                    Don Juan of Disco, he imbues his performances
                    with just the right level of self-awareness.</p>

                    
                <p>Rather than Nick Smith, or even audience
                    surrogate Tom Townsend, the film receives a
                    moral compass through Audrey Rouge (Carolyn
                    Farina), the most virginal of the group’s female
                    contingent. Drawn to Tom, she claims she hasn’t
                    experienced any kind of romantic attachment
                    previously, though upon sharing with Tom her
                    passion for classic literature (Austen, of course)
                    she is struck down by Townsend’s pseudo-intellectual dismissal of Mansfield Park based on
                    Lionel Trilling’s essay (he has not read the book
                    or many others for that matter). The fact that Tom
                    is even misunderstanding the thrust of Trilling’s
                    essay is a further punchline for those in the know.
                    Despite this, she continues her pursuit of a man
                    who openly mocks her lifestyle. As Joseph Alulis
                    notes in his essay ‘In Defense of Virtue: Whit
                    Stillman’s Metropolitan’ , Audrey stands out as a
                    character of particular virtue due to having not
                    just an awareness of the anachronistic society she
                    inhabits, but the respect she has for the conventions
                    of the bourgeoisie.7 Very Austen, and Stillman
                    acknowledges this, such as in the aforementioned
                    Society interview: “the idea that you cannot have
                    an innocent, virtuous heroine today sort of made
                    me think, “Well, yes there can be one.” And so my
                    Audrey character became a kind of Fanny Price.”
                    It feels like something of a mission statement.</p>
                <p>Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco express
                    sentiments similarly against the grain. Set at
                    the end of the Cold War, Barcelona may give
                    tacit admissions to destructive CIA tactic but
                    it’s impossible to interpret many scenes, and the
                    character of Ramon at large, as anything other
                    than a critique of quasi-Marxist anti-Americanism,
                    especially when the film ends with a scene of two
                    beautiful Spanish women charmed by the great
                    lakes of Chicago. The latter picture takes a stance
                    no less controversial in the 1990s: maybe disco was
                    good? Granted, the film takes place in the dying
                    days of the movement, in clubs comprising many
                    young professionals who have snuck in higher-ups
                    for a bonus, but the social harmony woven through
                    Studio 54’s panorama of dancing and ‘pairing off ’
                    is nonetheless presented with nostalgic joy. There
                    is a dramatic irony how Jimmy and Josh, the most
                    outspoken disco fans of the ensemble, are the pair
                    most responsible for the movement’s downfall.
                    The police department’s crackdown on the disco
                    scene and the subsequent club closures are
                    presented as justice being done (again, small ‘c’
                    conservative), and we are left to ruminate on
                    the awkward shuffles and sexually transmitted
                    diseases of disco with the characters. Much like in
                    Metropolitan, Stillman’s prowess as a storyteller
                    comes into vision as he uses his understanding of human interaction and wordplay to instigate
                    reevaluation from an audience.</p>
                <p>Following a broadly unfruitful decade in Paris,
                    Stillman returned to filmmaking in 2011 with
                    Damsels in Distress, the first time his work played
                    into a well-established genre. Frat/sorority movies
                    have not been ‘in’ for a long time, but even if
                    there was still a market for such comedies I doubt
                    they would be frothing at the mouth to see Whit
                    Stillman and Greta Gerwig’s take on the formula.
                    Some of the discourse surrounding the film upon
                    its release echoes that which surrounded the
                    release of PT Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love in
                    2002: is this meta-commentary on such a lowly
                    subgenre from the auteur? Perhaps it’s nothing
                    deeper that PTA/Stillman quite like romantic/
                    college comedies and wanted to dabble in it.</p>

            <img src="images/discreet-2.jpg" alt="">
            <p id="subtitle">Image from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)</p>

                <p>Damsels in Distress is probably the *least* beloved
                    of Whit’s films and it probably is his worst. The
                    so-called trilogy can be enjoyed by viewers who
                    perceive Stillman as having his tongue firmly
                    planted in his cheek, as well as those taking a more
                    earnest approach. One’s enjoyment of Damsels in
                    Distress rests on the viewer possessing a certain
                    wide-eyed sincerity going in, as they are expected
                    to readily accept the (seemingly surreal) theses of
                    the film: college bros are so stupid they deserve
                    our sympathy and education; dance crazes are the
                    20th century’s most lasting cultural contributions,
                    and the smell of a good motel soap really can heal a
                    heartbreak. Thus the film can take a while to warm
                    to and didn’t seem to attract many unsuspecting
                    new disciples, but again the trickery of the subtle
                    reevaluation is at work in the background. I, for
                    one, was baffled by the film’s comedic timing (as
                    well as Megalyn Echikunwoke’s British accent) but
                    by the end…. Thor can do the Sambola? Fuck yeah!
                    In the context of this analysis, it’s almost frustrating
                    that Stillman’s latest film, Love & Friendship (2016)
                    is so undeniably lovely and universally acclaimed.
                    It’s probably for the best, on the other hand, that his
                    attempts to make films about Jamaican prayer music
                    and the Chinese cultural revolution fell through.
                    Stillman is a filmmaker who is at his best inhabiting
                    a particular world—the thought of him writing a
                    character without a trust fund (or the 18th-century equivalent thereof) is jarring. Nevertheless, we
                    should be grateful for the work we have, which
                    comprises one of modern cinema’s most curious
                    catalogues. As we saw with the negative reception
                    online to Adam McKay’s environmental disaster-
                    comedy Don’t Look Up last year, earnest liberalism
                    is not the zeitgeist in Trump-cum-Biden’s America,
                    yet appreciating art politically at odds with your
                    beliefs is, of course, essential in any textual analysis.</p>
                <p>In Barcelona, there’s a scene which seems, in
                    hindsight, to surmise my essay quite succinctly:
                    Fred (Eigeman’s NATO lackey) professes to Ted (his
                    stuck-up cousin) his new-found love of reading.
                    But, he asks, what is above the subtext? “The text,”
                    replies Ted, “but they never talk about that!” For
                    these characters, there is little to differentiate
                    between text and subtext, in fact,“they appear to
                    have no subtext at all”.9 Particularly in the 1990s,
                    there’s something to be celebrated in that: if Whit
                    Stillman were to direct a remake of The Discreet
                    Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Charlie would be much
                    less disappointed.</p>
