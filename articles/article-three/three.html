    <div id="text">
        <p>From Outer Space was originally created
            by two movie maniacs from distant parts
            of Russia as an ordinary fan blog for
            cult horror, science fiction and fantasy
            films. Gradually, the content grew out
            of control and became increasingly
            obscene and obscure. From Outer Space
            is a Russian-language project, therefore
            we are especially attracted to unusual
            films from the USSR and strange post-
            Soviet cinema.</p>
        <p>It was a hectic time of new ideas and
            opportunity. With the collapse of
            the Soviet Union, filmmakers gained
            freedom to express their ideas. Cinema
            became more creative and daring,
            more liberated, but also restrained by
            cheaper budgets. Some films screened
            only in a couple of cinemas. Many
            were shot for video format. Creators
            deliberately refused to distribute their
            films and sometimes even destroyed
            them out of shame. Many of these
            films are still considered irretrievably
            lost. Sometimes there aren’t records of
            frames or accurate information, only a
            title. All kinds of legends revolve around
            such films: experiments ahead of their
            time, scandals around episodes with
            blood and nudity, drunken debauchery,
            criminal showdowns on the set.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what happened with «The
            Hour of the Werewolf», a film among
            the first and last late Soviet horrors.
            Notes from old magazines («Soviet
            Screen») and the memories of its rare
            viewers have survived. Many were
            lauded by the scenes of the protagonist’s
            transformation from a human into a
            werewolf. The director later told us
            that the crew originally planned to use
            excellent latex makeup from Thailand.
            But the postal service could not deliver
            it to the USSR. Therefore the actor
            embodied a monster with almost no makeup and the desired effect
            was achieved mainly through acting
            according to the Stanislavsky system.</p>
        <p>We queried all possible local archives
            and funds, including Ukrainian ones
            (due to the film’s Odessa origins), about
            where we could find a copy. Eventually,
            we found the director: Igor Shevchenko,
            who did not even imagine that his film
            might be of interest to anyone today.
            The creator did not have a copy of the
            film, but he promised to help us in our
            search. With the support of the director
            and cinematographer of «The Hour
            of the Werewolf», we contacted the
            Gosfilmofond of Russia and received the
            long-awaited film, which was digitized
            and restored. For those who found the
            time of Perestroika, this was a miracle!</p>

        <p>But even more mysterious and
            confusing was the story of the search
            for the legendary film «AntiFaust».
            Some described it as outlandish
            mystical avant-garde like something
            from Buñuel, while others called it the
            second «Mister Designer» — another
            then-cult Russian movie forgotten for
            thirty years.</p>
        <p>The story of this film began in 1990 when
            Georg Friesen, a young German from
            Hanover, came to Russia and enrolled
            in filmmaker courses at VGIK. In 1993
            he directed the film «AntiFaust» — a
            romantic extravaganza, saturated with
            non-standard visuals and an instantly
            immersive soundtrack. Friesen was
            clearly inspired by the films of Friedrich
            Murnau and Peter Greenaway. As
            intended, the film stood out from the
            background of stereotypical 90s Russian
            film production.</p>
        <p>Friesen returned to Germany shortly
            after the premiere. «AntiFaust»
            remained undistributed and unreleased.
            The film disappeared, becoming an
            unattainable artifact. The inhabitants
            of the forums composed legends about
            it, which was supplemented by small
            bits of information from Soviet film
            magazines.</p>
        <p>The search for «AntiFaust» has continued over the
            years. None of those who took part in the filming
            had a copy or information about where it could be
            found. It was clear to everyone that the director
            himself was the key figure in this story, but absolutely
            nothing was known about his fate either.</p>

        <img src="images/image-three.png" alt="">
        
        <p>After checking all possible and impossible options,
            addresses, sites and social networks, my friend and
            I, on behalf of the From Outer Space community,
            were able to find a man named Andreas. He
            communicated with Georg when their children
            went to the same school. Fortunately, Andreas kept a
            phone number for the mysterious director and, after
            a while, we were able to contact him!</p>
        <p>Friesen regretted that the only Betacam copy of
            «AntiFaust» was lost in a flood in the basement of
            his house. The director said that the film had two
            camera operators. Perhaps a copy was kept by the
            second one?</p>
        <p>The second cameraman was Dmitry Ermakov. We
            found his friends, who helped us contact him and
            find out if he had the last copy of «AntiFaust» in
            existence. All these years Dmitry had kept that VHS
            in his collection as he considered the film to be a
            failure. A careless re-recording of some 90s show
            could have thrown «AntiFaust» into the abyss of
            oblivion. But now, almost thirty years later, people
            can watch this film for the first time!</p>
        <p>It’s amazing how many more stories there are about
            lost films. One of the most controversial stories is
            the one about the adaptation of «The Dwarf Nose»,
            a fairy tale by Wilhelm Hauff. This film was shown
            on Soviet television in the 1980s and made an
            eerie impression on viewers with its gloomy and
            oppressive atmosphere. Eyewitnesses claim that
            frighteningly realistic makeup was used in the
            film and the mystical atmosphere of the plot was
            frightening to the core.</p>
        <p>Subcultures of seekers have gathered around this
            film. While one group is looking for some unknown
            TV show, another is sure that the missing «The Dwarf
            Nose» is a 1975 Bulgarian teleplay. Others believe
            that the film was shot on Leningrad television and is
            stored in their archives. Everyone else is convinced
            of the Mandela Effect. For them this film does not
            even exist and that all eyewitness memories of the
            film are false.</p>

        <img src="images/image-four.jpg" alt="">
        <p id="subtitle">Image from The Nose (1963)</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, we contacted the Austrian
            broadcaster ORF about an unknown film
            adaptation called «Zwerg Nase» («The Dwarf
            Nose», 1963). It turned out that it was shown
            on TV only twice in the 1960s and then lay
            on the shelf. We hoped that this would be that
            legendary film. But in fact it was an ordinary
            TV play, filmed among cardboard background
            sets on black and white film. Perhaps one day
            this mysterious film will be found.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is only a small part of our
            search. We have also started to delve into Polish
            animation from the 60s, cheap science fiction
            from the 70s, selected trash from the 80s, and
            dark Russian exploitation from the 90s. As
            always, we remain fascinated by stories about
            films that were never filmed and lost films.
            Along with expanding the arsenal of our finds
            – forbidden Yakut mystical horrors, surrealism
            from Azerbaijan, unknown silent films of the
            1920s, and so on – we are also engaged in the
            restoration of cult Russian films from the 90s,
            many of which have only survived on bad VHS
            such as «Dina» (1990), «Thirst for Passion»
            (1991), and «Contact» (1992).</p>
        <p>We communicate with collectors of films and
            VHS, write to small regional archives and funds
            and find directors, cameramen and actors of
            forgotten films of the recent past. Some might
            think that these films are no longer needed and
            are not of interest. Yet every time we dig into
            these bowels of cinematic abyss, we discover
            new, forgotten pearls. Our goal is to retrieve it
            from the very depths of the forgotten archives.</p>
        <p>Believe me, there are so many pearls!</p>
